It's dark and silent
Where am I?
Warmth surrounds my body
My eyes are closed, but I see
Colours that soothe the soul
Moving as part of this world
Taken into the ebb and flow
Diving deeper,
Beckoned by dolphins,
They appear and dance around me
Brushing against my skin, tickling
I swim closer, speaking in thought,
So innocent and friendly
I understand it's safe beneath the waves

Is this real?
Is this real?

*Everybody changes underwater
Everybody changes underwater
Everybody changes underwater

I come up for air,
Eyes wide open, everything is new,
Water cascades into the cool pool.
I move from the water to a garden,
Fruit hangs from the trees,
I reach up and take it
It's ripe, soft, and sweet
A field of long grass
I run my fingers through the blades
Mmmm... feeling sleepy
I lie back, closing my eyes,
The sun soothes me.
I begin to feel lighter,
Floating higher and higher,
Higher and higher.

*Repeat

Everybody changes underwater

There's now darkness.
Looking down, the world is far below.
If I fall, who will catch me?
Space, everywhere at once and nowhere at all.
Floating, a small part of the endless universe
I feel glowing stars,
Pulsating and radiant, so warm to touch.
A blinding light appears,
Silhouettes and voices I recognize,
They reach out their hands
And welcome me, like angels.

Is this real?
Is this real?
