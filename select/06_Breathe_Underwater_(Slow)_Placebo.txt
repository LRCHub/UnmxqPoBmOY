Here comes another fall from grace
I'm always falling on my face, oh
This attitude that I embrace
For the love I'm trying to replace, oh

I try to kill the song
'Cos the melody's all wrong
And there's a fever coming on
I try to kill the song
'Cos the melody's all wrong
And there's a fever coming on

And I can breathe underwater
But I'm coming up for air
I wanna see another dawn
I can breathe underwater
But I'm coming up for air
I've been floating here too long

Take my ego for a ride
'Cos there's no one by my side, oh yeah
It's getting hard to justify
It won't be long til I collide, oh yeah

My weaknesses laid bare
As people stop and stare
But it's the last time I swear
My weaknesses laid bare
As people stop and stare
But it's the last time I swear

And I can breathe underwater
But I'm coming up for air
I wanna see another dawn
And I can breathe underwater
But I'm coming up for air
I've been floating here too long

(Start breathing)
(Start breathing)
(Start breathing)
(Start breathing)

It's time to reconcile what I've become (Start breathing, start breathing)
With the wounded child hiding deep inside (Start breathing, start breathing)
It's time to reconcile what I've become (Start breathing, start breathing)
With the wounded child hiding deep inside (Start breathing, start breathing)
It's time to reconcile what I've become (Start breathing, start breathing)
With the wounded child hiding deep inside (Start breathing, start breathing)
It's time to reconcile what I've become (Start breathing, start breathing)
With the wounded child hiding deep inside (Start breathing, start breathing)

(Start breathing, start breathing)
(Start breathing, start breathing)
(Start breathing, start breathing)
(Start breathing, start breathing)
