The opening of a window onto rapture
Find the world shining in me
The senses
Consciously holy
Make love by touching fingertips

Our coloured falls come in a thousand shades
The light is being betrayed
Misunderstood forgotten
Forgotten in the shade

Bluebirds take all of the consciousnesses
To where the elemental merges with beyond

Summer
Summer is gone
The autumn of my life
